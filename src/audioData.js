    According to The Music Origins Project, “AfroBeat originated in Ghana in the 1920’s, where 
    Ghanian musicians incorporated foxtrot and calypso to their rhythms. Around the late 1960’s 
    a man by the name of Fela Kuti, also dubbed as the Father of AfroBeat would soon add his spice 
    to it and later making it very popular amongst Nigerian youth from about 1970-1975. A true Pioneer.”`,

    history: `Amapiano

    Amapiano (Zulu for "the pianos") is a style of house music that emerged in South Africa in 2012.
     It is a hybrid of deep house, jazz and lounge music characterized by synths and wide percussive basslines.
     The genre used to be called 'number'. But MFR Souls came up with the name 'amapiano' and popularized it. They are the ones 
     who started it.”`,
